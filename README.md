# <u>Extended World Map</u>

Extended World Map adds a fast, lightweight world map viewer to RuneLite. It is designed for viewing the game world as it actually exists with true 1:1 tile locations. This viewer operates much smoother than the vanilla world map, and allows you to freely pan around and see where OSRS *actually* brings you on your adventures, not just the very limited area offered by the vanilla map.<br>

## <u>What it does</u>

- Shows a full logical world map, with all locations visible at their true world coordinates
- Displays your live player position on the map
- Lets you switch between planes (0-3) to match the in-game level
- Syncs with the 'Ground Markers' plugin to display all markers you have created/imported with correct colors and tooltips for their labels
- Can keep the map centered on you as you move

## <u>What it does NOT do</u>

- Show instances or other dynamically loaded maps that get created on-demand by quests/bosses/POH/etc.
- Show OTHER players.
- CREATE new ground markers, this still must be done by right clicking the map or importing.
- DELETE existing ground markers, this still must be done by right clicking the map or resetting the Ground Markers plugin.

## <u>How to open the map</u>

1. Log in to the game.
2. Right-click the World Map orb.
3. Choose one of the options:
   - "**Show** Extended Map Dock" - This is an overlay which lives inside the RuneLite window, it will remember the size and screen location selected, and it sits on top of everything else. This is best used with larger monitors that have plenty of room for a large overlay.
   - "**Show** Extended Map Window" - This is a separate window that opens and can be dragged freely outside the RuneLite window. This is better if you're using a smaller window size, as the dock will consume a large block of the screen.

### Dock (top), Window (bottom)

## <u>Controls</u>

### Pan and zoom
- Click and drag to move around the map
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out

### Docked window tips
- Hold Shift and drag to reposition the docked window
- Drag near the edges of the docked window to resize it

## <u>Options</u>

Extended World Map includes a small set of toggles to customize what you see:

- **Show Player**: Show/hide your live position marker, similar to the regular world map
- **Track Player**: Keep the map centered on you automatically, persists through teleports and height changes
- **Jump To Player**: Return the viewer to your live position marker
- **Show Region Grid**: Show/hide region boundaries with a full-map grid
- **Show Ground Markers**: Show/hide ground markers that have been created/imported  
- **Plane selector**: Switch between height levels (planes) 0-3

## <u>Performance notes</u>

- The map image being used is VERY large (13,056 x 45,568 pixels), it is encoded and dynamically rendered to operate with as little overhead as possible, however on lower end devices, it may not perform well.
- The map loads in the background and uses a tile cache to stay responsive.
- You can adjust the cache size in the plugin configuration to trade memory usage for smoother viewing. It defaults to 512mb.

## <u>Disclaimers & Limitations</u>

- There is not a feasible way to draw the map in real-time due to the complex encryption Jagex uses for it, so this plugin uses an externally downloaded `.atlas` file which is just a fancy PNG with layering & level-of-detail scales.
- The stored `.atlas` file size may change slightly between updates, it is usually around **60 MB** on disk. The file is created with PNG data that is generated by RuneLite's own <a href="https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/cache/src/main/java/net/runelite/cache/MapImageDumper.java">Map Image Dumper</a>, it is then packed into the atlas extension using a <a href="https://github.com/Avexiis/ExtendedMapViewer_Resources/blob/main/PackMap3D.py">Python script</a>.
- The map only shows the regions included in the downloaded `.atlas` file, however the plugin will auto-update the map data soon after any potential map updates from Jagex. This process happens independently of full-plugin updates.
- Map functions, such as dungeon tooltips and agility shortcuts are baked into the image and are non-interactive. This will be addressed in a future update.
